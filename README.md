# Akai

Akai (Ëµ§‰∫ï) - Japanese for _color of the rising sun_ - is a Mac app, that resides in the menu bar. Given access to the calendar, it shows todays events from the `Exchange` calendar in a dropdown menu with the option, to join an attached Skype meeting by simply clicking on it's name.

## Live in Action

If the event has a Skype meeting attached, the name of the event is clickable and let's the user directly join the Skype session. If there's no Skype meeting attached, then the name of the meeting location is shown (e.g. _Bar 21 / Hamburg_ in the recorded screencast).

## Installation

Download Akai from the [release page](https://github.com/nicolai92/mac-akai/releases/tag/v1.0), unzip the file and copy the app to the program's folder. _Note_: While _Akai_ is the name during the development, the _official_ name of the app is _Join Skype_ - to cause a little confusion üôÇ

## Usage

When first launching Akai, the app asks for access to the calendar. This is necessary, to read today's events from the `Exchange` calendar. After that, the app resides in the menu bar and reveals the events by clicking on it's icon (which is a Skype logo). Checkout also the recorded screencast above.
