# Akai

Akai (赤井) - Japanese for _color of the rising sun_ - is a Mac app, that resides in the menu bar. Given access to the calendar, it shows todays events from the `Exchange` in a dropdown menu with the option, to join an attached Skype meeting by simply clicking on it's name.

## Live in Action

If the event has a Skype meeting attached, the name of the event is clickable and let's the user directly join the Skype session. If there's no Skype meeting attached, then the name of the meeting location is shown (e.g. _Bar 21 / Hamburg_ in the recorded screencast).
